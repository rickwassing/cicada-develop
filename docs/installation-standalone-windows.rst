Install Cicada for Windows
==========================

.. note::

    Very sorry, but this section of the documentation is not well developed yet. The instructions are based on my presumptions of how it 'should' work. I will develop this page as soon as I have access to a Windows PC.

1. `Download <https://github.com/rickwassing/cicada-app-installers/archive/master.zip>`_ and unzip the Cicada App Installer.
2. Open 'install-cicada-0.1.2_MSWin.exe'
3. Follow the installation process by clicking 'Next >'.
4. It is **highly** recommended to use the default installation folders.

Start Cicada
============

1. Navigate to the Cicada installation folder, i.e. 'C:\Program Files\Cicada'.
2. open 'Cicada.exe'.
