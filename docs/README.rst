# Cicada
Open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices

## Getting Started

Cicada is written in Matlab R2019b. I invite anyone to download the source files and contribute to the project. If you don't have Matlab, download the compiled executables Cicada.exe (Windows) or Cicada.app (MacOs).

## Contributing

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Current verion is 0.1.2. Cicada is still in initial development. Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.

## Acknowledgments

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects. 
I would kindly thank:
* Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process accelerometry data [CRAN project](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html). 
* Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.
