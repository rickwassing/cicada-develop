# Cicada

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Current verion is 0.1.2. Cicada is still in initial development. Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.

> I am a neuroscientist, foremost, and not a software developer. Although I have ample experience in Matlab and other coding-languages, and I have coded Cicada to the best of my abilities, it may not be the most efficient way the software could have been written. I would be very grateful for anyone who'd like to contribute to Cicada.

## Acknowledgments

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process actigraphy data. [Visit the GGIR CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html).
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The standalone desktop application does not require a Matlab license or any other software.

### Run Cicada as a standalone application

1. Download the application installer from the Cicada GitHub repository.

-   [Download for MS Windows]()
-   [Download for MacOS]()

2. [Describe installation process].

## Run Cicada as a Matlab application

1. You're required to have Matlab R2018b or later.
2. Download the code or clone the repository.
3. Open Matlab and navigate to the path where the Cicada directory is located (or add the Cicada directory to the Matlab Search Path).
4. Call the Cicada application in the Command Window:

```matlab

>> cicada

```

## Documentation

All documentation can be found on the [Cicada Read The Docs site](https://cicada-actigraphy-suite.readthedocs.io).

Thank you for reading this far! Have a nice day.
