# Cicada

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

## Getting Started

Cicada is written in Matlab R2019b. I invite anyone to download the source files and contribute to the project. If you don't have Matlab, and just want to use the software, download the compiled executables Cicada.exe (Windows) or Cicada.app (MacOs)from the [Cicada repository].

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Current verion is 0.1.2. Cicada is still in initial development. Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.

## Acknowledgments

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process accelerometry data. [Visit the GGIR CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html).
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.
