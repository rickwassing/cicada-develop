# Cicada

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analyzing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Current version is 0.7. Cicada is still in development and currently ONLY works in Matlab 2019b. Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.

> I am a neuroscientist, foremost, and not a software developer. Although I have ample experience in Matlab and other coding-languages, and I have coded Cicada to the best of my abilities, it may not be the most efficient way the software could have been written. I would be very grateful for anyone who'd like to contribute to Cicada.

## Acknowledgements

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

- Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process actigraphy data. [Visit the GGIR CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html).
- Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.

## Documentation

All documentation can be found on the [Cicada Read The Docs site](https://cicada-actigraphy-suite.readthedocs.io).

Have a nice day.
