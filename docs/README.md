# Cicada

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Current verion is 0.1.2. Cicada is still in initial development. Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.

## Acknowledgments

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process accelerometry data. [Visit the GGIR CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html).
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.

## Getting Started

Cicada is written in Matlab R2019b. I invite anyone to clone the repository and contribute to the project. If you just want to use the software, you don't need Matlab, just download the compiled executables Cicada.exe (Windows) or Cicada.app (MacOs)from the this [Cicada repository].

The data from actigraphy and/or other wearable devices are stored in a structure, named 'ACT'. This structure is highly similar to that of the ['EEG' structure](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/A05:_Data_Structures) used in [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php).

### Functions

-   **package/appFunc** contains all functions that start with 'app\_'. They contruct the graphical user interface by updating each component's properties upon events and changes in the data.
-   **package/cicadaFunc** contains all high-level functions that start with 'cic*' and either manipulate the data directly or call sub-functions to do so. This organization is highly similar to the 'pop*' functions in EEGLAB.
-   **package/mountFunc** contains all functions that start with 'mount\_', which are used to draw graphical objects such as, 'plot()', 'patch()' and 'barh', or other components such as 'uiaxes()' and 'uipanel'.
-   **package/supportFunc** contains all other functions that are used by the aforementioned functions.

### Settings files

-   **settings/CicadaSettings.json** specifies the default settings for displaying the data, epoch length, and importing sleep diary data.
-   **settings/xSleepDiary.json** specifies the format and column number (index) of the date and time used to encode the sleep diary data. Multiple .json files can be specified, loaded, edited and saved in order to load sleep diaries with different formatting.
