Cicada
======

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

.. _index-version:

Version 0.1.2 (beta)
===================

Cicada is still in initial development. **Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.**

.. _index-help:

Your help is more than welcome!
===============================

I am a neuroscientist, foremost, and not a software developer. Although I have ample experience in Matlab and other coding-languages, and I have coded Cicada to the best of my abilities, it may not be the most efficient way the software could have been written. I would be very grateful for anyone who'd like to contribute to Cicada.

Acknowledgments
===============

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process accelerometry data. `Visit the GGIR CRAN repository`_.
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the `Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox`_ and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.

Dependencies
============

You can download the standalone desktop application which does not require a Matlab license or any other software. However, if you want to contribute or adapt the code, a Matlab license is required.

.. _index-usage:

Cicada as a standalone application
==================================

Download the application installer from the Cicada GitHub repository, 
- for MS Windows (here) or 
- for MacOS (here). 

[Describe installation process].

Cicada develop source code
==========================

- Download the code as a .zip file (`here <https://github.com/rickwassing/cicada-develop/archive/master.zip>`_) or clone the Cicada-develop GitHub repository (`here <https://github.com/rickwassing/cicada-develop>`_). 
- Open Matlab and navigate to the path where the Cicada directory is located (or add the Cicada directory to the Matlab Search Path).
- Call the Cicada application in the Command Window:

.. code-block:: matlab

  >> cicada
