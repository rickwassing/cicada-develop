.. _index-help:

Your help is more than welcome!
-------------------------------

I am a neuroscientist, foremost, and not a professional software developer. Although I have ample experience in Matlab and other coding-languages, and I have coded Cicada to the best of my abilities, it could still be improved with your help. I would be very grateful for anyone who'd like to contribute to Cicada.

Acknowledgments
---------------

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process actigraphy data. `Visit the GGIR CRAN repository`_.
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the `Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox`_ and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.

Run Cicada as a Matlab application
----------------------------------

1. You're required to have Matlab R2018b or later.
2. Download the code  `as a .zip file <https://github.com/rickwassing/cicada-develop/archive/master.zip>`_ or `clone the Cicada-develop GitHub repository <https://github.com/rickwassing/cicada-develop>`_. 
3. Open Matlab and navigate to the path where the Cicada directory is located (or add the Cicada directory to the Matlab Search Path).
4. Call the Cicada application in the Command Window:

  .. code-block:: matlab

    >> cicada
