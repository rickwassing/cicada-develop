Cicada
======

This repository contains the source files for Cicada, an open source software for analysing actigraphy and data from other wearable devices.

Verion 0.1.2 (beta)
===================

Cicada is still in initial development. **Anything may change at any time and the software should not be considered stable.**

Your help is more than welcome!
===============================

I am a neuroscientist, foremost, and not a software developer. Although I have ample experience in Matlab and other coding-languages, and I have coded Cicada to the best of my abilities, it may not be the most efficient way the software could have been written. I would be very grateful for anyone who'd like to contribute to Cicada.

Acknowledgments
===============

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

-   Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process accelerometry data. `Visit the GGIR CRAN repository`_.
-   Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the `Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox`_ and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.
